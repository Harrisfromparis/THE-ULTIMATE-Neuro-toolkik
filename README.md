# Mathflix (Recovery in Progress)

This repository is a reconstruction of the original “Mathflix” project that was built inside GitHub Spark (AI app prototype environment). I reached the Spark editing limit and am now migrating the project into a standard GitHub repository for safekeeping and continued development.

## Current Status
- Repository created (empty scaffold beginning)
- Source code files still need to be copied from Spark manually
- Package/config files (e.g. `package.json`) not yet added (will be next)

## Immediate Plan
1. Add README (this file)  ✅
2. Copy `package.json` (or generate a scaffold if it’s missing)
3. Add `src/` folder and all component / data files from Spark
4. Add any assets (images, PDFs, audio, video) found in Spark’s Assets tab
5. Commit and tag an initial “recovery” snapshot

## How the Recovery Works (Simple)
- Open Spark → open code view (</> icon)
- For each file: Select All → Copy → Recreate the same path here → Paste → Commit
- We will start with `package.json`, then config files, then `src/`, then assets

## If `package.json` Cannot Be Found
We’ll generate a standard Next.js + TypeScript scaffold and drop the recovered components into it.

## Recovery Log
- (Add entries here as you complete steps, e.g.)
  - YYYY-MM-DD: Created repository
  - YYYY-MM-DD: Added README

## Next Action
Add the `package.json` file (instructions will follow in the chat).

This README will be expanded once the codebase is fully recovered.
